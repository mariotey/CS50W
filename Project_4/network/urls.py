# The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first.
# Each post should include the username of the poster, the post content itself, the date and time at which the post was made, and the number of “likes” the post has (this will be 0 for all posts until you implement the ability to “like” a post later).
